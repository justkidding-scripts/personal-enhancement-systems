- **Files**: `advanced_enhancement_system.py`
- **Components**:
  - **DatabaseManager**: SQLite-based metrics storage
  - **AdvancedMonitoringSystem**: Real-time activity monitoring with OCR
  - **EnhancementEngine**: AI-powered recommendation system
- **Features**:
  - Screen content analysis via OCR
  - Process monitoring and analysis
  - System performance tracking
  - Productivity pattern detection
  - Action plan generation
  - Comprehensive reporting

### 4. Enhancement Manager (Central Hub)
- **Purpose**: Central control hub for all enhancement systems
- **Files**: `enhancement_manager.py`, `enhance` (launcher script)
- **Features**:
  - System status overview
  - Testing capabilities
  - Command-line interface
  - Launcher script creation
  - Bash aliases integration
